--- Global Feature Analysis (AI Interpreted) ---
This report is based on an analysis of audio features including RMS (loudness), Spectral Centroid (brightness), ZCR (noisiness), and MFCCs (timbral qualities).

Studie No. 2 presents a dynamic and timbral journey characteristic of atonal and non-traditional compositions. The overall dynamics (RMS) are highly volatile, commencing from silence and building through intense periods, peaking at significant climaxes around 99 seconds and a final, even more powerful, surge at 149 seconds, before ultimately decaying back to complete silence. This wide dynamic range underscores a highly gestural and unfolding structure rather than a conventional melodic or harmonic progression. Timbrally, the piece is a constantly shifting soundscape. The Spectral Centroid reveals frequent and dramatic fluctuations in brightness, often starting or ending sections with piercing high frequencies or sudden shifts to darker, more fundamental sounds, particularly at climaxes. The ZCR values indicate a substantial reliance on noisiness and percussive textures, ranging from near-silent, pure tones to overwhelming bursts of unpitched sound. This suggests a focus on the intrinsic qualities of sound rather than pitched harmony. Concurrently, the MFCCs demonstrate a continuous and profound transformation of the tonal color, moving between thin, sparse textures and rich, complex ones, often uncorrelated with dynamic or brightness trends, implying a deliberate avoidance of stable instrumental identities in favor of evolving sonic masses. The rhythmic structure, as inferred from these parameters, is inherently non-metric and fluid. The constant shifts in RMS suggest a rhythm driven by intensity peaks and troughs, while the highly variable ZCR points to an irregular, event-based percussive character rather than a steady beat. The continuous, often dramatic, changes in 'Key' further reinforce the atonal nature, indicating a deliberate avoidance of traditional harmonic rhythm in favor of unpitched or freely shifting pitch centers, contributing to a sense of perpetual motion and transformation.
